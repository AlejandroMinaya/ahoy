**What functionality would improve this emulator? Optionally, include the reasoning behind this request**
Add a brief description of what do you expect this feature to do
> e.g. _"I would like this emulator to have configurable color themes. I believe that depending on the games you play, you can choose colors to match the mood or the idea"_


**What does the MVP of this feature looks like?**
Add a list or a couple of sentences detailing the boxes you would expect a _minimum-value product_ version to check
> e.g. _"A first version would be to be able to select between at least two preset themes"_

**(Optional) What does the _everything but the kitchen sink_ version of this feature looks like?**
Add a list or couple of sentences detailing the boxes you would expect a _fully fledged_ version to check
> e.g. _"An all the bells and whistles version of this feature would allow you to create and manage your own colors schemes. Being able to export and import themes in a shareable format such as JSON or something along those lines."_
